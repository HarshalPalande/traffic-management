# Intelligent-Real-time-TrafficMonitoringSystem

  Traffic monitoring and Management systems are one of the most difficult challenges facing metro cities due to the increase of vehicular density. Increased vehicular density of roads is accompanied by a number of problems such as traffic jams and breaking traffic rules and roads. Intelligent traffic monitoring is an attractive solution to solve these issues. 
  With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), advanced monitoring can be achieved for better decision making.

  This repository presents a prototype for an intelligent real time monitoring system that captures real-time video, processes and detects traffic elements (cars, trucks, buses, 
motorcycles, bicycles and trains) using deep neural networks. More specifically, installed cameras on the road continuously capture the road, vehicles are next detected in each frame to later extract significant information that will be uploaded to the database. These processed results can be accessed using a web user interface. Not only that, but the user interface permits accessing the live feed of the camera. Another feature is the ability of the user interface to detect vehicles from an uploaded picture.

Key words: traffic management, video processing, convolutional neural network, yolo-v3, object detection, client-server communication, user interface
